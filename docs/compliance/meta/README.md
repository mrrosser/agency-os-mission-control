# Meta App Review Compliance Pack

This folder contains the minimum documentation to support Meta App Review data handling questions for public-authority requests.

## Files

- `public-authority-requests-policy.md`
  - Governs legal review, challenge process, minimization, and recordkeeping.
- `public-authority-request-runbook.md`
  - Step-by-step operational procedure for handling requests.
- `public-authority-request-log.csv`
  - Request register template with required fields.
- `meta-app-review-answers.md`
  - Copy/paste draft answers for current Meta App Review questions.

## Checkbox mapping (`requests-4`)

These docs support checking all of the following, if adopted and followed in practice:

1. Required review of legality of requests.
2. Provisions for challenging requests considered unlawful.
3. Data minimization policy (minimum necessary disclosure).
4. Documentation of requests, responses, legal reasoning, and actors.

## Adoption checklist

1. Set an effective date in policy and runbook.
2. Name the responsible person for compliance review.
3. Store the request log in an access-controlled location.
4. Train operators to use the runbook and log for every request.
5. Keep evidence of use (log entries + supporting docs).

Important: only check boxes in Meta if this process is actually in force and followed.
